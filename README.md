# LeaningTowerDallas
Leaning Tower of Dallas .obj and .stl file.
This is a low res scan, and I intend on uploading a higher quality scan when possible. Feel free to reach out if you want the .mtl and texture files, Github's file size limit is holding me back. I am still trying to find a way to effeciently archive models on Github
